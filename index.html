            In this tutorial you will be shown how to set up and use Git Bash on Mac. This tutorial is may not work on Macs made before 2018 as they used a different terminal shell back then.

        <h2>1. Install Homebrew</h2>
        <div>
            Open a web browser and enter brew.sh in the searchbar or click <a href="https://brew.sh/">here.</a> The website should look something like this.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 9.57.34 AM.png" width="60%"><br>
            Click the button to the right of the line of text, inidicated in the next image.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 9.57.34 AM copy.png" width="60%"> <br>
            This button will copy the code. Now open the terminal and paste with Command + V or rightclick and select "paste".<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 10.08.55 AM.png" width="50%"><br>
            A whole bunch of text will appear on screen. Eventually it will stop and Homebrew will be installed. Unfortunatly, I already installed Homebrew so I couldn't get an image of the install process. Just know that when the text stops, it should be installed.
        </div>
        <h2>2. Install Git Bash</h2>
        <div>
            Now that Homebrew is installed, type "brew install git" in the terminal.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1.48.11 PM.png" width="50%"><br>
            This should bring up a whole new load of text. You may have to enter your password for your computer. Once again Git Bash is already installed on my device so I could not capture any images of the process. Once the text stops Git Bash should be installed.
        </div>
        <h2>3. Creating a Repo!</h2>
        <div>
            Okay! Now that we have Git Bash installed, it's time to make a repo. Go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and click the signup button if you are new or the login button if you already have an account.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 10.24.46 AM.png" width="75%"><br>
            Once you are logged in it should look something like this.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 10.30.37 AM.png" width="100%"><br>
            Click the indicated button to create a new github repository.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 10.33.55 AM.png" width="50%"><br>
            Give your repo a name and an optional description. Leave every other setting how it is. Press "Create repository"<br>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 10.36.28 AM.png" width="50%"><br>
            Open the terminal again type "cd " and then drag the folder that you want to add to to your repo into the terminal.<br>
